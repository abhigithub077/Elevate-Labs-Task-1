# Elevate-Labs-Task-1
I have used Excel to clean a raw sales dataset which included Sales amount, sale date and other sales information. I used basic excel formulas to perform the above task.

## Steps Performed
Identified and removed the null values using the filters option in excel.
Dropped duplicate values using Remove duplicates feature.
Changed format for dates (dd-mm-yyyy).
Fixed datatypes for currency and payment modes.
Renamed column headers with proper punctuation.
